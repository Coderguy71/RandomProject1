PROBLEM STRUCTURE
=================
Each problem includes:
  ✅ Question text (clear SAT-style math problem)
  ✅ Four multiple choice options (A, B, C, D)
  ✅ Correct answer (single letter)
  ✅ Detailed explanation (step-by-step reasoning)
  ✅ Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
  ✅ Subtopic ID (UUID reference)
  ✅ Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

DATABASE TABLE
==============
practice_problems
  id              UUID PRIMARY KEY
  subtopic_id     UUID NOT NULL (references subtopics)
  question_text   TEXT NOT NULL
  options         JSONB ({"A": "...", "B": "...", "C": "...", "D": "..."})
  correct_answer  VARCHAR(255) (single letter: A/B/C/D)
  explanation     TEXT
  difficulty_level VARCHAR(50) (easy/medium/hard)
  created_at      TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
  updated_at      TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

SAMPLE PROBLEMS
===============

1. LINEAR EQUATIONS (Easy)
   Q: "What is the value of x in the equation x - 7 = 3?"
   Options: A: x=8, B: x=9, C: x=10, D: x=11
   Answer: C
   Explanation: "Add 7 to both sides: x = 3 + 7 = 10"

2. QUADRATIC EQUATIONS (Hard)
   Q: "For what values of c does x² + 6x + c = 0 have no real solutions?"
   Options: A: c>9, B: c>8, C: c>10, D: c>12
   Answer: A
   Explanation: "Discriminant < 0: 36 - 4c < 0. So 36 < 4c, c > 9"

3. SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS (Medium)
   Q: "Solve: 3x + 2y = 8 and x + y = 3"
   Options: A: x=2, y=1, B: x=1, y=2, C: x=3, y=0, D: x=4, y=-1
   Answer: A
   Explanation: "From second: x = 3 - y. Substitute into first equation..."

4. GEOMETRY - CIRCLES (Hard)
   Q: "Two concentric circles have radii 4 and 6. What is the area between?"
   Options: A: 4π, B: 8π, C: 12π, D: 20π
   Answer: D
   Explanation: "Area between = π(6²) - π(4²) = 36π - 16π = 20π"

5. 3D SHAPES & VOLUME (Medium)
   Q: "A cylinder has radius 2 and height 5. What is its volume?"
   Options: A: 10π, B: 15π, C: 20π, D: 25π
   Answer: C
   Explanation: "Volume = πr²h = π(2²)(5) = π(4)(5) = 20π"

HOW TO DEPLOY
=============

1. Ensure database is running:
   psql sat_math_platform (or start PostgreSQL service)

2. Run migration:
   npm run db:migrate

3. Verify data in database:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM practice_problems;
   Expected: 97+ problems

4. View problems by subtopic:
   SELECT s.name, COUNT(p.id) 
   FROM practice_problems p
   JOIN subtopics s ON p.subtopic_id = s.id
   GROUP BY s.name;

5. View sample problem:
   SELECT question_text, correct_answer, difficulty_level 
   FROM practice_problems 
   WHERE subtopic_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440010'::uuid 
   LIMIT 1;

IF ROLLBACK NEEDED
==================
npm run db:migrate:down

This will safely rollback the migration without affecting other data.
